<p>Internet Banking, also known as net-banking or online banking, is an electronic payment system that enables the customer of a bank or a financial institution to make financial or non-financial transactions online via the internet. This service gives online access to almost every banking service, traditionally available through a local branch including fund transfers, deposits, and online bill payments to the customers. 

    Internet banking can be accessed by any individual who has registered for online banking at the bank, having an active bank account or any financial institution. After registering for online banking facilities, a customer need not visit the bank every time he/she wants to avail a banking service. It is not just convenient but also a secure method of banking. Net banking portals are secured by unique User/Customer IDs and passwords.
